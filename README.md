# N-gram-Diacritizer-Arabic
Arabic is generally written without vowels which can be an issue especially for children and non-natives. This model automates diacritization of vowelless Arabic text using N-grams

- Places vowels in each word based on N words of given context.
- The model is trained on the Tashkeela corpus https://sourceforge.net/projects/tashkeela/
